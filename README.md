# Matteo Veraldi's toolchain for React
This is a very minimal React boilerplate to work without frameworks. \
:warning: this toolchain is not suitable for production, use it only for playgrounds. 
## What is the goal? 
I would like this boilerplate to be as minimalistic as possible, and to be configured in a way that it will be suitable to publish React libraries.
## Available features out of the box
- :fire: Hot Realoading
- :boom: jest & testing-library support
- :bulb: eslint with React and React hooks support.
## To-Do features (sorted by priority)
* Add eslint and configuration for React :heavy_check_mark: done!
* npm publish feature
* Opt-in for Typescript
* Opt-in for Sass
